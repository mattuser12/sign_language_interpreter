# Sign Language Real Time Interpreter 
Requirements:
* Tensor Flow 2.X.X
* OpenCV
* Python
* Jupyterlab
* Labelimg

Recommended:
* Anaconda
* Docker (either)

More signs can be added by running the preparation code and adding images using the labelimg library. It is recommended to train the model at 20000 cycles or a loss function equal to <0.14, whichever comes first.
